PGObject::Util::DBAdmin - PostgreSQL Database Management Facilities for
PGObject

=head1 VERSION

version 1.6.0

our $VERSION = '1.6.0';


=head1 SYNOPSIS

This module provides an interface to the basic Postgres db manipulation
utilities.

 my $db = PGObject::Util::DBAdmin->new(
    connect_data => {
       user     => 'postgres',
       password => 'mypassword',
       host     => 'localhost',
       port     => '5432',
       dbname   => 'mydb'
    }
 );

 my @dbnames = $db->list_dbs(); # like psql -l

 $db->create(); # createdb
 $db->run_file(file => 'sql/initial_schema.sql'); # psql -f

 my $filename = $db->backup(format => 'c'); # pg_dump -Fc

 my $db2 = PGObject::Util::DBAdmin->new($db->export, (dbname => 'otherdb'));

 my $db3 = PGObject::Util::DBAdmin->new(
    connect_data => {
       service     => 'zephyr',
       sslmode     => 'require',
       sslkey      => "$HOME/.postgresql/postgresql.key",
       sslcert     => "$HOME/.postgresql/postgresql.crt",
       sslpassword => 'your-sslpassword',
    }
 );


=head1 PROPERTIES

=head2 connect_data

Contains a hash with connection parameters; see L<the PostgreSQL
documentation|https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/libpq-connect.html#LIBPQ-PARAMKEYWORDS>
for supported parameters.

The usual parameters are:

=over

=item * user

=item * password

This hash variable contains as its keys the names of the PostgreSQL helper
executables C<psql>, C<dropdb>, C<pg_dump>, etc. The values contain the
paths at which the executables to be run are located. The default values
are the names of the executables only, allowing them to be looked up in
C<$PATH>.

Modification of the values in this variable are the strict realm of
I<applications>. Libraries using this library should defer potential
required modifications to the applications based upon them.

=head1 SUBROUTINES/METHODS

=head2 new

Creates a new db admin object for manipulating databases.

=head2 BUILDARGS

Compensates for the legacy invocation with the C<username>, C<password>,
C<host>, C<port> and C<dbname> parameters.

=head2 verify_helpers( [ helpers => [...]], [operations => [...]])

Verifies ability to execute (external) helper applications by
method name (through the C<operations> argument) or by external helper
name (through the C<helpers> argument). Returns a hash ref with each
key being the name of a helper application (see C<helpers> below) with
the values being a boolean indicating whether or not the helper can be
successfully executed.

Valid values in the array referenced by the C<operations> parameter are
C<create>, C<run_file>, C<backup>, C<backup_globals>, C<restore> and
C<drop>; the methods this module implements with the help of external
helper programs. (Other values may be passed, but unsupported values
aren't included in the return value.)

Valid values in the array referenced by the C<helpers> parameter are the
names of the PostgreSQL helper programs C<createdb>, C<dropdb>, C<pg_dump>,
C<pg_dumpall>, C<pg_restore> and C<psql>. (Other values may be passed, but
unsupported values will not be included in the return value.)

When no arguments are passed, all helpers will be tested.

Note: C<verify_helpers> is a class method, meaning it wants to be called
as C<PGObject::Util::DBAdmin->verify_helpers()>.

=head2 server_version([$dbname])

Returns a version string (like 9.1.4) for PostgreSQL. Croaks on error.

When a database name is specified, uses that database to connect to,
using the credentials specified in the instance.

If no database name is specified, 'template1' is used.

=head2 create

Creates a new database.

Croaks on error, returns true on success.

Supported arguments:

=over

=item copy_of

Creates the new database as a copy of the specified one (using it as
a template). Optional parameter. Default is to create a database
without a template.

=head2 run_file

Run the specified file on the db.

After calling this method, STDOUT and STDERR output from the external
utility which runs the file on the database are available as properties
$db->stdout and $db->stderr respectively.

Croaks on error. Returns true on success.

Recognized arguments are:

=over

=item file

Path to file to be run. This is a mandatory argument.

=item vars

A hash reference containing C<psql>-variables to be passed to the script
being executed. Running:

   $dbadmin->run_file(file => '/tmp/pg.sql', vars => { schema => 'xyz' });

Is equivalent to starting the file C</tmp/pg.sql> with the command

   \set schema xyz

To undefine a variable, associate the variable name (hash key) with the
value C<undef>.

=item stdout_log

Provided for legacy compatibility. Optional argument. The full path of
a file to which STDOUT from the external psql utility will be appended.

=item errlog

Provided for legacy compatibility. Optional argument. The full path of
a file to which STDERR from the external psql utility will be appended.

=head2 backup

Creates a database backup file.

After calling this method, STDOUT and STDERR output from the external
utility which runs the file on the database are available as properties
$db->stdout and $db->stderr respectively.

Unlinks the output file and croaks on error.

Returns the full path of the file containining the backup.

Accepted parameters:

=over

=item format

The specified format, for example c for custom.  Defaults to plain text.

=item file

Full path of the file to which the backup will be written. If the file
does not exist, one will be created with umask 0600. If the file exists,
it will be overwritten, but its permissions will not be changed.

If undefined, a file will be created using File::Temp having umask 0600.

=item tempdir

The directory in which to write the backup file. Optional parameter.  Uses
File::Temp default if not defined.  Ignored if file parameter is given.

=item compress

Optional parameter. Specifies the compression level to use and is passed to
the underlying pg_dump command. Default is no compression.

    return $output_filename;
}


=head2 backup_globals

This creates a file containing a plain text dump of global (inter-db)
objects, such as users and tablespaces.  It uses pg_dumpall to do this.

Being a plain text file, it can be restored using the run_file method.

Unlinks the output file and croaks on error.

Returns the full path of the file containining the backup.

Accepted parameters:

=over

=item file

Full path of the file to which the backup will be written. If the file
does not exist, one will be created with umask 0600. If the file exists,
it will be overwritten, but its permissions will not be changed.

If undefined, a file will be created using File::Temp having umask 0600.

=item tempdir

=head2 restore

Restores from a saved file.  Must pass in the file name as a named argument.

After calling this method, STDOUT and STDERR output from the external
restore utility are available as properties $db->stdout and $db->stderr
respectively.

Croaks on error. Returns true on success.

Recognized arguments are:

=over

=item file

Path to file which will be restored to the database. Required.

=item format

The file format, for example c for custom.  Defaults to plain text.

=back

=cut

sub restore {
    my ($self, %args) = @_;
    $self->{stderr} = undef;
    $self->{stdout} = undef;

    croak 'Must specify file' unless defined $args{file};
    croak 'Specified file does not exist' unless -e $args{file};

    return $self->run_file(%args)
           if not defined $args{format} or $args{format} eq 'p';

    # Build command options
    my @command = ($helper_paths{pg_restore}, '--verbose', '--exit-on-error');

    defined $self->connect_data->{dbname}   and
        push(@command, '-d', $self->connect_data->{dbname});
    push(@command, $args{file});

    $self->_run_command(command => [@command],
                        error   => "error restoring from $args{file}");

    return 1;
}


=head2 drop

Drops the database.  This is not recoverable. Croaks on error, returns
true on success.

=cut

sub drop {
    my ($self) = @_;

    croak 'No db name of this object' unless $self->dbname;

    my @command = ($helper_paths{dropdb});
    push(@command, $self->connect_data->{dbname});

    $self->_run_command(command => [@command],
                        error   => 'error dropping database');

    return 1;
}


=head1 CAPTURING

This module uses C<Capture::Tiny> to run extenal commands and capture their
output, which is made available through the C<stderr> and C<stdout>
properties.

This capturing does not work if Perl's standard C<STDOUT> or
C<STDERR> filehandles have been localized. In this situation, the localized
filehandles are captured, but external system calls are not
affected by the localization, so their output is sent to the original
filehandles and is not captured.

See the C<Capture::Tiny> documentation for more details.

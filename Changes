      * Add support for the 'pg_isready' tool

1.5.0   2021-09-25

      * More meaningful error messages

      * Add optional parameter to 'list_dbs' and 'server_version'

1.0.3   2019-09-29
      * Run 'verify_helpers' test only in AUTHOR_TESTING mode as it

0.131.0 2019-07-06
      * Sanitize the environment before shelling out to external programs,

0.130.1 2018-06-05
      * Correct typos in documentation

0.130.0 2018-04-21

      * Document effect of localizing filehandles on output capture
      * Add `compress` parameter to backup() method
      * Set DB_TESTING=1 to run file tests as they require postgreSQL utilities
      * In Makefile.PL, correctly classify test deps as TEST_REQUIRES

0.120.0 2018-03-27
      * Documentation fixes
      * Don't use shell to execute external commands, blocks command injection
      * Trap shell errors running external commands
      * Test exit code after running external commands
      * Don't attempt to parse stderr from external commands for errors
      * External command stdout/stderr available via object property

      * Create backup output files with umask 0600
      * Delete incomplete backup files after error
      * Raise exceptions with croak/carp rather than die/warn
        external psql command now run with `--set=ON_ERROR_STOP=on`
        external pg_restore command now run with `--exit-on-error`
      * Bump minimum perl version to 5.10

0.100.0 2016-12-17
      * Publish 0.10 as 0.100; CPAN considers 0.09 equal to 0.090, which is
        higher than 0.10.0 (which is 0.010_000)
